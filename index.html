                    <br> Do you like to breed dinos like a mad man? We got you covered. Do you like to be the protector of the server and mediate for others? We got you covered! Do you like to PVE but also like knowing that opposition can be lurking in a bush nearby? We got you covered!! Do you want to finally get the chance to fight bosses on a server with others? WE GOT YOU COVERED!!!
                    <br>
                    <br> This cluster has higher rates to bypass the tedious grinding so you can get building quicker, into pvp quicker, and after an invasion back on your feet quicker for that sweet sweet revenge.
                    <br>
                    <br> By the way. This server does not wipe! Except for that one time... When the settings significantly changed... Wiping may have a fun, fresh, and exciting feel for a few days or so, but for those who invest in a server it can be annoying, pointless, and needlessly disruptive. A lot of servers like to wipe to give that fresh feel to everyone but with higher rates the fresh feel doesn't last long. We want long term players here. Players that care to invest their time and know a server wipe will not destroy that investment. Besides, players can do that part. Wouldn't it be more rewarding to join a server as the underdog, make allies, build up, then go after the big dog and put a muzzle on them? That's what a Badd Neighbor does!
                    <br>
                    <br> When you join our cluster you can press F1 to read up on some stuff and things to include event info and also to join our Discord if you have not done so already and revisit our website. As a tribe, you also get to your very own tribe tab from here. This tab has 2 sections. A section that is editable by everyone in the tribe for leaving notes for each other, and another section that is editable by only tribe admins for leaving notes and messages to the peons.

                <br> - You are allowed turrets at ONLY 2 locations per map (a location can be a base)
                <br>
                	<ul>
                		<li>1 of these locations can have beds nearby, the other location cannot

                	</ul>
                <br> - DO NOT name your player, dinos, or structures vulgar words
                <br> - DO NOT be a piece of shit and stream snipe our streamers
                <br> - DO NOT build at obelisks or their immediate perimeters
                <br> - DO NOT build in any artifact cave or obstruct players from entering them in any way
                <br> - DO NOT leave behind structures used for taming creatures
                <br> - DO NOT mesh or glitch your character under, through or into the map terrain
                <br> - DO NOT mesh or glitch your character under, through or into any type of structure
                <br> - DO NOT use rafts, motorboats, or platform saddles to mesh your structures into enemy structures
                <br> - DO NOT block more than 1 side of a platform dino with structures
                <br> - DO NOT "inside" your tribe
                <br> - DO NOT be toxic in global chat
                <br> - DO NOT use vulgar language in global chat
                <br> - DO NOT pod, cage, incapacitate, or imprison players over 30m
                <br> - DO NOT raid the same base within a 6 hour period
                <br> - DO NOT foundation wipe bases unless you build a base there afterwards
                <br> - DO NOT make vacuum compartments invisible - they must be noticeable
                <br> - DO NOT try to kill passively protected dinos or circumvent the intention of the mod
                <br>
                <br> - PVP is inevitable, understand it WILL happen, and in many forms
                <br> - It is good practice to have backup plans in case you get raided
                <br> - Its unfortunate server settings can't please everyone - you dont HAVE to play here :)
                <br> - Good PVP sportsmanship and trash talking is encouraged - it's ARK
                <br> - You can trash talk the server owner or any admin - they are players not gods
                <br> - Fostering the server population and recruiting is requested
                <br> - Bring over your friends from other servers or even better invite your enemies
                <br> - Streamers are welcomed, watch their streams to support them
                <br> - You can leave teleporters and transmitters around the map IF they are unlocked
                <br> - You are allowed to cover your rider on a platform saddle or raft
                <br> - Tribe owners will be held responsible for their tribe where applicable - OWN your tribe
                <br>
                	<p align="justify">
                	<br> - It is commonly known that ARK is not a very well-polished game. Similarly to being on official, if you lose stuffs due to lag, game issues, random glitchyness, oddities, crashes, or not knowing something can happen the way it does; it is gone and will not be replaced unfortunately. It can be very time consuming to verify and validate each occurrence since it happens too often. It is also too easy for someone to claim false incidents. If you lose stuffs due to something caused directly by the server owner, there is possibly hope for you.
                	<br>
                	<br> - You are asked to follow the rules of this server. If you do not follow the rules for whatever reason you have there are different courses of action that will be taken depending on the situation and severity. You may be asked to correct the issue. Dinos, structures, or items might be removed for you. You may get banned. It is the player's responsibility to read, understand, and comply with the rules. Tribe owners have a responsibility to ensure certain rules that are within their control are not broken due to lack of organization.
                	<br>
                	<br> - If you see someone not following the rules, speak with them in chat if possible. To escalate the issue join discord and post screenshots or videos in the Report Violations channel.

               <h2 class="major">Donate</h2>
               <span class="image main"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rApbIBL.png" alt=""></span>
               <p align="justify">
                  If you enjoy the community, the players, the owner, or the cluster setup and you feel you want to show your support, donating is one way to do it.<br><br>
                  Donations will never be used as a way to gain an advantage over others.<br><br>
                  If you choose to support Badd Neighbor via donation you will be offered a few things as a thank you for your support:<br><br>
                  The first is a custom icon to display next to your name in the games chat window that is visible when you send messages.  Similar to how admins have a star in front of their names you can have a custom icon in front of yours.  These icons can be pretty much anything from a dino, structure, weapon, tool, ammo, armor, buff or consumable item that is in game.  If there is a picture or icon of it in game somewhere it can probably be used.  To get ideas you can check out a robust but incomplete list here <a href="http://icons.baddneighbor.com"><b><font color="red">HERE</font></b></a>.  If someone already has an icon picked out no one else will be allowed to use it unless they are ok with it.<br><br>
                  The second is receiving a custom color to your liking for your discord name in the cluster's Discord.  Any color can be used as long as you can find the 6 digit color code.  You can find colors and their 6 digit color codes here <a href="http://colors.baddneighbor.com"><b><font color="red">HERE</font></b></a>.  The codes will always start with a # and are 6 characters long.<br><br>
                  The third is to have your name added to the Donator role in the cluster's Discord which will display your Discord name at the top of the member list above other members, the bots, and owner's name.<br><br>
                  Stuff that donations could possibly cover:
               <ul>
                  <li>costs towards maintaining the www.baddneighbor.com domain name
                  <li>costs towards additional plugins if needed (e.g., Anti Mesh)
                  <li>offset costs for server hardware upgrade
               </ul>

               <span class="image main"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Nfuw60n.jpg" alt=""></span>
               - Free starter packs are available in the vault (lower level farming type dinos, metal tools, starter armor)<br>
               - Players earn ARc (Auto Reward Credit) points over time for playing on the server and being active<br>
               - 1 point for every 15 minutes of being logged into a map<br>
               - 5 points for every day you have logged in to that map<br>
               - Points are accumulated on a per map basis<br>
               - Each map keeps track of points separately and individually<br>
               - ARc points are used to purchase reward packs from the Reward Vault<br>
               - You can earn lots of ARc points by keeping your character logged into a map while you are afk<br>
               - You can convert your ARc points into an in-game item called ARc bars<br>
               - ARc bars can be used for trading with others, pooled together by tribemates to obtain more expensive rewards, or can be consumed to add points back into your vault for safe keeping<br>
               - You can have a maximum of 500 points in your vault before you stop accumulating points.  You will have to spend the points on packs or you can turn them in to ARc bars and stash somewhere.<br>
               - Select items have ARc bars added to their crafting recipe<br>
               - Events on the cluster will reward players with ARc points/bars<br>
               - There are several dozens of different reward packs to choose from.  To name a few:<br>
               <ul>
                  <li>Select Items/Materials/Dinos from Expansions (in case you don't have those expansions)<br>
                  <li>Skins you cannot normally obtain<br>
                  <li>Skins that are more difficult to obtain<br>
                  <li>Emote and Hair Style Unlocks<br>
                  <li>A few dinos that are difficult to tame or are untamable like the Troodon, Phoenix, Alpha Raptor, or Zombdodo<br>
               </ul>

                  (Bad Neighbor was a safe base concept ruleset.  Players had to submit a declaration for war to raid other bases.  The above photo was the first ever declared raid on the server.)<br><br>
                  The history of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BadNeighbor/"><font color="red">Bad Neighbor</font></a> started back in November of 2015 shortly after ARK was released to Early Access on Steam.  It was around till May of 2016 before it went into hiding only to emerge several years later in December of 2018 bigger than before and baDDer than before as BaDD Neighbor.  Double the D's, Double the... everything else.<br><br>
